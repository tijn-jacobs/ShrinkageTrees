\description{
This dataset contains RNA-seq gene expression data and associated sample annotations
from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PAAD) tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),
as compiled and distributed in the \code{pdacR} package.
}
\details{
The expression data (\code{ex}) includes 20,531 genes across 181 primary tumors.
The sample information (\code{sampInfo}) includes 55 clinical and molecular variables
(e.g., tumor purity, mutations, subtypes, survival outcomes).
Additional metadata and gene feature annotations are provided.

This dataset is derived from the TCGA PAAD cohort (accession: DbGaP phs000178, BroadGDAC: PAAD).
It was processed and summarized in Raphael et al. (2017), and further curated, integrated, and
distributed via the open-source \code{pdacR} package as described by Torre-Healy et al. (2023).
