\description{
A processed subset of the TCGA pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PAAD) dataset, prepared for flexible survival and molecular analyses. This reduced dataset contains clinical covariates, survival data, expression values of selected driver genes, and the top 3,000 most variable non-driver genes.
}
\details{
This data frame includes:
\itemize{
\item \strong{time}: Overall survival time in months.
\item \strong{status}: Censoring indicator: 1 = event, 0 = censored.
\item \strong{treatment}: Treatment indicator: 1 = radiation therapy, 0 = control
\item \strong{age}: Age at initial pathologic diagnosis (numeric).
\item \strong{sex}: Binary sex indicator: 1 = male, 0 = female.
\item \strong{grade}: Tumor differentiation grade (ordinal: 1 = well, 2 = moderately, 3 = poorly, 4 = undifferentiated).
\item \strong{tumor.cellularity}: Pathologist-reviewed tumor cellularity (numeric).
\item \strong{tumor.purity}: Tumor purity class (binary: 1 = high, 0 = low).
\item \strong{absolute.purity}: Absolute purity estimate (numeric).
\item \strong{moffitt.cluster}: Moffitt transcriptional subtype (binary: 1 = basal-like, 0 = classical).
\item \strong{meth.leukocyte.percent}: DNA methylation leukocyte percent estimate (numeric).
\item \strong{meth.purity.mode}: DNA hypermethylation mode purity (numeric).
\item \strong{stage}: Nodal stage indicator (binary: 1 = n1, 0 = n0).
\item \strong{lymph.nodes}: Number of lymph nodes examined (numeric).
\item \strong{Driver gene expression columns}: Expression values of known driver genes (KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, BRCA1, BRCA2, etc.).
\item \strong{Other gene expression columns}: Expression values for the top ~3,000 most variable non-driver genes (selected based on median absolute deviation).

This dataset is derived from the TCGA PAAD cohort (accession: DbGaP phs000178, BroadGDAC: PAAD) and was processed as described in Raphael BJ et al., Cancer Cell, 2017 (PMID: 28810144). The dataset includes selected clinical covariates for potential prognostic and predictive modeling and is designed to facilitate reproducible survival and genomics analyses in pancreatic cancer.
