\arguments{
\item{status}{Event indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored). Required for survival.}

\item{X_train}{Design matrix for training.}

\item{X_test}{Optional test matrix (defaults to column means of X_train).}

\item{number_of_trees}{Number of trees (default 200).}

\item{k}{Hyperparameter for the prior variance of the step heights.}

\item{N_post}{Number of posterior samples to draw.}

\item{N_burn}{Number of burn-in iterations.}

\item{verbose}{Print sampling progress.}

\item{y}{Outcome vector of right-censored (non-negative) survival times.}

\description{
Fits an Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model using the original BART prior:
We fit a BART model to f:
log(y) = f(x) + ε.
}
\details{
This function provides a simplified interface for fitting an AFT model with
the classical BART prior using the internal \code{ShrinkageTrees} engine.
Right-censored survival data are handled via data augmentation within the
tree sampler.

Compared to the full \code{ShrinkageTrees} function, \code{SurvivalBART} fixes several hyperparameters.
This wrapper is intended as a convenient survival-specific version of BART for
users who do not need advanced shrinkage priors.
