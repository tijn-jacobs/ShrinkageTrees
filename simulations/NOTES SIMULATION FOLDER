These folder contain all the files and results to the simulations performed for the article "Horseshoe Forests for High-Dimensional Causal Survival Analysis"

Each folder contains the code to run the simulation in and generate the graphics. It also contains the results of the simulation stored in .rds files.

We performed the following simulations:
- Main simulation (see Section). In the folder: 'Main sim'
- Friedman simulation over more p (see Section). In the folder: 'Deeper Friedman'
- Simulation with highly correlated covariates (see Section). In the folder: 'Robust sim"
- Simulation with a misspecified error distribution (see Section). In the folder: 'Robust sim"
- Simulation with a dense model (see Section). In the folder: 'Robust sim"
- Hyperparameter tuning (see Section). In the folder: 'Hyperparameter tuning 1' and 'Hyperparameter tuning 2'
